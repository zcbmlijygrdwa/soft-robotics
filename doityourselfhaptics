    vibrotactile devices
    {
        cell phones;
        easiest way;
    }

    force feedback systems
    {
        fe = -fh;
        user can feel the object;
    }

    surface displays
    {
        touching surface can be simulated by moving a surface based on finger's position;
    }

    tactile displays
    {
        spatially distributed sensations at the skin's surface;
    }

    the art of nonrealistic usefulness and realism through shortchuts
    {
        devices can be usefull even though they cannot deliver realistic sensations;
        (example: LCD color display, cannot produce real optical fiilds but still useful);
    }

vibrotactile stimulation
{

    rumble motor
    {
        a motor spins an eccentric mass;
    }

    tactor
    {
        a voice coil motor drives a small surface of matrial;
        placed in contact with the skin;
    }

    inertial motor
    {
        combination of rumble motor(inertial mass) and tactor(voice coil- actuated);
    }

    electronics&software
    {
        vibrotactile can be seen as haptics sensations without "DC component";
        can be achieved by using electronics&software designed for audio applications;
        frequency is limited to 1000 HZ.

Force feedback

    Impedance vs Admittance approaches
    {
        impedance, need energe to stop from moving;

        admittance, need energe to assist moving;
    }

    Ideal vs Reality: difficulties
    {

        Inertia
        {
            when loaded(inertia)
            {
                motor runs at required freq with low amplitude;
                motor runs at required amplitude with low freq;
            }
        }

        Structural Dynamics
        {
            structure mode;
            resonances;     
        }

        Losses
        {
            mechanical losses
            {
                1. backlsh in the joints: "equibalent damping";
                2. friction;
            }

            electrical losses
            {
                ohmic losses;
            }
        }

    }

    Kinematic structure
    {
        haptics interfaces are generally parallel (rather than serial linkages): max strengthm, min inertia;

        joints can be powered by
        {
            cable capstan;
            direct motor drive;
        }
    }


    Sensors
    {
        resolution in haptics
        {
            important for simulating virtual surface(fine texture);
            not important for simulating poking onto a wall;
        }
    }

    Actuators
    {
        good choice - DC motor:
        {
            torque is propotional to current;

            three popular kinds
            {
                Wound DC motor
                {
                    normal;
                }

                Coreless motor (prefered in haptics)
                {
                    small size;
                    rapid acceleration;
                }

                Brushless motor
                {
                    less overheating;
                }
            }
        }

    }

    Amplifiers
    {

        current vs voltage
        {

            voltage regulation;

            current regulation(prefered)
            {
                min electrical dynamics from inductance;
            }
        }

        PWM vs analog
        {
            PWM amplifiers
            {
                cause radiate electric;
                cause acoustic noise;

                but cheap;
            }

            analog amplifiers
            {
                precise;
                quiet;


                but overheating;
            }
        }
    }

    Control Issues
    {

        Mechanics that can be simulated
        {
            level 1
            {
                tool is fixed to virtual object;

                penetrations
                {
                    hard tool - hard object;
                    hard tool - soft object;
                    soft tool - soft object;
                }
            }

            level 2
            {
                sliding contact between tool and object;
            }

            level 3
            {
                object is allowed to translate and rotate;
            }

        }

        cross-cutting isssues
        {
            Quantization caused calculation results lag behind the lasted measurement(Incorrect control output for current time point);
        }

        stability Issues
        {
            devices have nonlinearities;
        }

        Simulation "Marginally stable" approaches
        {
            By updating fast
            {
                updaint fast can give better resolution;

                converge to losses because of sampling and quantization(no need to go faster);

                need to decouple fast updating part from those not requiring fast updating;
            }

            By computational damping
            {
                damp system by feedback;
                two limits
                {
                    hard to estimate velocity from position measurements;
                    delay in feedback also cause destablizing;
                }
            }

            By other approaches
            {
                discrete-time signal processing (compensate for delay using prediction/correction method);
                programmable physiacal damping;
                feeding forces in open-loop;
            }
        }
    }

    reconstruction
    {
        zero-oder hold (usually used)
        {
            converting a discrete-time signal to a continuous-time signal;
            holding each sample value for one sample interval;
        }


        low freq system
        {
            amplifiers handle reconstruction;
            linkage of a device phtsically handle reconstruction;
        }

        high freq system
        {
            need low-pass reconstruction filter to handle;
        }

    }
}

A simple surface display

Haptics device performace
{

    Rule 1: Where to make measurement is important
    {
        system's view: measured betwee motors and dsiplacement sensors;

        user's view: measured at where the device is touched;
    }


    Rule 2: The load should be specified and controlled;

    Rule 3: If forces are measured, the force sensor should be stationary;

    Rule 4: Sensors must ahve sufficient resolution;

    Rule 5: Haptics devices have serveral types of nonlinearities;
