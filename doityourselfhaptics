    vibrotactile devices
    {
        cell phones;
        easiest way;
    }

    force feedback systems
    {
        fe = -fh;
        user can feel the object;
    }

    surface displays
    {
        touching surface can be simulated by moving a surface based on finger's position;
    }

    tactile displays
    {
        spatially distributed sensations at the skin's surface;
    }

    the art of nonrealistic usefulness and realism through shortchuts
    {
        devices can be usefull even though they cannot deliver realistic sensations;
        (example: LCD color display, cannot produce real optical fiilds but still useful);
    }

vibrotactile stimulation
{

    rumble motor
    {
        a motor spins an eccentric mass;
    }

    tactor
    {
        a voice coil motor drives a small surface of matrial;
        placed in contact with the skin;
    }

    inertial motor
    {
        combination of rumble motor(inertial mass) and tactor(voice coil- actuated);
    }

    electronics&software
    {
        vibrotactile can be seen as haptics sensations without "DC component";
        can be achieved by using electronics&software designed for audio applications;
        frequency is limited to 1000 HZ.

    Impedance vs Admittance approaches
    {
        impedance: need energe to stop from moving;

        admittance: need energe to assist moving;
    }

    Ideal vs Reality
    {

        Inertia;

        Structural Dynamics;

        Losses;

    Control Issues
    {

        Mechanics that can be simulated;

        cross-cutting isssues;

        stability Issues;

        Simulation "Marginally stable" by updating fast;

        Simulation "Marginally stable" by computational damping;


        Simulation "Marginally stable" by other approaches
        {
            discrete-time signal processing (compensate for delay using prediction/correction method);
            programmable physiacal damping;
            feeding forces in open-loop;

A simple surface display

Haptics device performace
{

    Rule 1: Where to make measurement is important
    {
        system's view: measured betwee motors and dsiplacement sensors;

        user's view: measured at where the device is touched;
    }


    Rule 2: The load should be specified and controlled;

    Rule 3: If forces are measured, the force sensor should be stationary;
    
    Rule 4: Sensors must ahve sufficient resolution;
    
    Rule 5: Haptics devices have serveral types of nonlinearities;
